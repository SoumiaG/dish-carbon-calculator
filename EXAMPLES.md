## Real-World Impact

### If you made one swap per week:

**Scenario**: Replace one beef meal with a plant-based meal weekly

**Annual Savings**:
- **CO₂ Saved**: ~208 kg CO₂e per year
- **Equivalent to**:
  - Not driving 936 km (582 miles)
  - Planting 10 trees
  - Taking 23 fewer flights (short-haul equivalent)

### If everyone in a city of 1 million did this:

**Annual Impact**:
- **208 million kg CO₂e** saved
- Equivalent to:
  - Taking 45,000 cars off the road for a year
  - Powering 28,000 homes for a year
  - Planting 10 million trees
